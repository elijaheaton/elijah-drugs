On December 3, 2021, I was struck by a car while riding an electric scooter in Baltimore. I was immediately taken to Johns Hopkins where they figured out that I had four fractures across both hands and one foot. Luckily, I have the use of a couple fingers on my right hand to be able to type! To help me deal with the pain, the doctors prescribed Ibuprofen, Tylenol, and OxyCodone. After a week, I stopped needing to take each drug every six hours and wanted a way to monitor my progress while also keeping my mind busy.

As I slowly work on this project, typing one key at a time, I want to think of different ways to visually show recovery over time. Ideas always welcome!

This repo contains personal information about my recovery.
