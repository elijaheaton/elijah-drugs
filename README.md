On December 3, 2021, I was struck by a car while riding an electric scooter in Baltimore. I was immediately taken to Johns Hopkins where they figured out that I had four fractures across both hands and one foot. Luckily, I have the use of a couple fingers on my right hand to be able to type! To help me deal with the pain, the doctors prescribed Ibuprofen, Tylenol, and OxyCodone. After a week, I stopped needing to take each drug every six hours and wanted a way to monitor my progress while also keeping my mind busy.

_This graph looks at how long I can go between uses of ibuprofen and tylenol. Note that I've taken ibuprofen more times, and that even though the most recent times I took these drugs at the same time, they look separate. Last updated January 4._

I recovered enough to use both of my hands, so I stopped working on this project.

This repo contains personal information about my recovery.
